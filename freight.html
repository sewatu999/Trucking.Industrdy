      America’s trucking industry is the bloodline of the U.S. economy. Nearly
      71% of all freight tonnage in America moves on the back of trucks. Moving
      11 billion tons of freight annually requires more than 3.6 million
      heavy-duty Class 8 trucks and over 3.5 million professional truck drivers.
      Without our industry, the American economy would come to a halt. By
      contrast, rail transportation accounts for about 13 percent of the
      nation’s freight tonnage.

      There are many types of truck freight, each with a unique yet important
      role for moving different truck freight across the nation and load boards
      make it easy to find truck freight. Companies ship a variety of truck
      freight ranging in size, value, and contents. It’s all thanks to truck
      freight and the specific trailers and equipment necessary for the
      dedicated men and women of the trucking industry to haul the freight.
