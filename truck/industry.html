        The transportation industry in the United States became part of the
        political and economic history of the United States in the 20th century.
        Trucking has been a part of the transportation industry since the late
        1800's Before the invention of automobiles, most freight was moved by
        trains or stagecoach vehicles.

        During World War I, the military was the first to use trucks
        extensively. Just before the First World War, there were approximately
        10,000 trucks operating in the United States. Many of these trucks were
        used for deliveries in or near major metropolitan areas. With the
        increased construction of paved roads, the transportation industry began
        to achieve significant foothold by the 1930s, and along came various
        government regulations. During the late 1950s and 1960s, transportation
        industry advanced by the construction of the Interstate Highway System.
        A extensive network of freeways linking major cities across the
        continent. Built for military and trucks to move commodity without
        overloading the local roads.

      <p>
        There are approximately 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the
        United States, according to estimates by the American Trucking
        Association(ATA). The total number of people employed in the industry,
        including those in positions that do not entail driving, exceeds 8.7
        million.

        The reality is that trucking is advancing even more into the future;
        self-driving trucks are already here and they’re already beginning to
        change the industry. But, automation won’t completely wipe out
        truck-driving jobs; it will likely only change the job duties.
