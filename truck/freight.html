        America’s trucking industry is the bloodline of the U.S. economy. Nearly
        71% of all freight tonnage in America moves on the back of trucks.
        Moving 11 billion tons of freight annually requires more than 3.6
        million heavy-duty Class 8 trucks and over 3.5 million professional
        truck drivers. Without our industry, the American economy would come to
        a halt. By contrast, rail transportation accounts for about 13 percent
        of the nation’s freight tonnage, goods using multiple modes of
        transportation - rail, ship, and truck. Freight is loaded in an
        intermodal container which enables movement across the various modes,
        reduces cargo handling, improves security and reduces freight damage and
        loss.

        There are many types of truck freight, each with a unique yet important
        role for moving diverse truck freight across the nation. There are four
        major types of freight transportation available for shippers to use in
        the world of freight shipping. The primary ones are by ground (road),
        rail, ocean, and air. Although these are the main categories of freight
        transportation, each method has their own processes that differ from one
        another. Companies ship a variety of truck freight ranging in size,
        value, and contents. It’s all thanks to trucking, for the dedicated men
        and women of the trucking industry to haul the freight.
