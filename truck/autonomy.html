      Autonomous vehicles would save the trucking industry billions and increase
      fuel efficiency, according to a Morgan Stanley report A lot has been
      happening in the world of self-driving trucks. More companies have
      emerged, technologies are being tested, laws are being considered, and the
      date for when it will be normal to see automated trucks on the road is
      getting closer and closer. Many in the industry are excited about this
      technology because it will help improve productivity, fuel efficiency,
      costs, and traffic on the highways. With the trucking industry continuing
      to move forward, the main thing on truck driversâ€™ minds is the security of
      their jobs. Despite concerns that a rise in automated vehicles will
      displace significant numbers of truck drivers, a new report finds that
      only a modest number of truck driver jobs, if any, will be affected

      Back in March 2017, Plus.ai became one of the first autonomous trucking
      companies to land a California Autonomous Vehicle Testing License, which
      is exactly what it sounds like. According to the California Department of
      Motor Vehicles, there are now 65 companies that hold one of these permits.
      Tech leaders and financiers alike are confident that self-driving trucks
      will become the norm as early as in the next decade, phasing out around
      1.8 million truck-driving jobs and saving the industry an estimated $300
      billion. Autonomous vehicles do not follow the rules of an uncertain labor
      market. In fact, they follow you every step of the way. More businesses
      are looking to increase automation to be more productive. Autonomous
      trucks equipped with short and long-distance radars, cameras, sensors, 3D
      mapping, and laser detection will surely revolutionize the industry.
      However, it will take some time for the public to get accustomed to the
      idea.
